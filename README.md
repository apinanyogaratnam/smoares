# Smores

## Description
A Web3 framework leveraging the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to develop
decentralized applications and smart contracts.

- command line interface to use to generate items
- read contracts using their abi and evm
- init command like the template web3 website repo generator (smore init)
- config file to setup the framework (custom commands, etc)
- command to generate a frontend application
- testing command
- generate boiler plate test cases
